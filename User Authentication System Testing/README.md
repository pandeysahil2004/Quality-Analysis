# User Authentication System Testing

## Test Plan Overview
This document outlines the test plan for the **User Authentication System**. The system includes features like user login, registration, password reset, and session management.

## Testing Objectives
- Ensure the login and registration workflows work with both valid and invalid inputs.
- Validate that password reset functionality sends a reset link correctly.
- Test session timeout and invalid session handling.
- Verify role-based access control for users with different roles (admin, regular user).

## Scope of Testing
1. **Functional Testing:** Testing of login, registration, password reset, and role-based access control functionalities.
2. **Security Testing:** Validation of session handling and secure login mechanisms.
3. **Usability Testing:** Ensuring that the user interface is intuitive and error messages are clear.
4. **Regression Testing:** Verifying that changes to the system do not affect existing functionalities.

## Tools Used
- **JIRA:** Defect tracking
- **Selenium:** For automated functional testing (if applicable)
- **Excel:** For documenting test cases and results
- **MySQL:** For backend database testing (user data validation)

## Test Deliverables
- Test case document with execution results
- Defect logs with severity and priority
- Test execution summary report

## Testing Approach
1. **Test Execution:** Manual testing of the systemâ€™s functionality using test cases.
2. **Bug Reporting:** Report issues and track them via JIRA.
3. **Verification:** Ensure all defects are fixed and test cases pass successfully.

## Expected Results
- Successful login with valid credentials.
- Correct error handling with invalid inputs.
- Password reset functionality works as expected.
- Role-based access control is enforced.
